# 🎽 Merch Sales Analysis 🛍️

Welcome to a fun little dive into the world of merch sales! This notebook is a playful exploration of sales data using Python and some basic data science tools. Nothing too fancy, just vibes and visuals. 📊✨

## 🧪 What’s Inside?

Here’s a quick walk-through of what you’ll find in the notebook:

### 📥 1. Data Loading
data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adarsh0806/influencer-merchandise-sales/data
We start by importing the usual suspects – `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – and loading the merch sales data. Basic cleaning happens here too: fixing column names, checking for nulls, and making sure the data types make sense.

### 🕵️‍♀️ 2. Exploratory Analysis
Next up, we get curious. The code looks into:
- Total sales across different months 📆
- Best-selling products 🥇
- Which cities love our merch the most 🏙️
- Time of day people are shopping ⏰

### 🧠 3. Insights Galore
We generate questions like:
- What’s the best month for sales?
- Which city buys the most?
- What product is bought the most, and does price affect quantity?
- What products are often bought together? (Hello, cross-sell ideas!) 💡

### 📈 4. Pretty Plots
Because what’s data analysis without some eye candy?
- Bar charts for monthly sales
- Line graphs for hourly trends
- Heatmaps to show product pairings
- Scatter plots for price vs quantity ordered

All done with love and some `seaborn` sauce. 💅

### 🤔 5. A Bit of Feature Engineering
We also do a bit of tweaking:
- Extracting months, hours, cities from raw data
- Creating new columns like `Sales` 💸
- Grouping and aggregating to find patterns

## 🎉 Why This Notebook?
Just a casual project to:
- Practice EDA (exploratory data analysis)
- Play with visualizations
- Think about customer behavior
- See how small decisions in data cleaning/feature engineering impact results

No production pipelines here, just data fun! 😎🌟
